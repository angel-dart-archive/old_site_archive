    <p>
        There are a few server-side frameworks rising within Dart at this moment, but Angel has a different goal than all the rest.
        Angel aims to be a server-side framework optimized for full-stack development. Angel users should be able to write
        both their backends and frontends entirely in Dart, and share as much code across each platform as possible.</p>
    <p>
        For this to work, Angel must be flexible, and have a low learning curve. Thus, the basic API is modeled after Express, and
        new functionality is added via plug-ins.</p>
    <p>
        The final goal of Angel is scalability. As your application grows, Angel aims to continue working, with little or no change
        in server-side configuration.</p>

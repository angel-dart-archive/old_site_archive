        Angel provides a wealth of functionality out of the box,
        which makes development faster. To expedite it even more,
        install the <a href="https://github.com/angel-dart/cli">Angel CLI</a>.
        <br>
        <code class="bash">$ pub global activate angel_cli</code>
        <br>
        You can bootstrap a complete application with one simple command:
        <br>
        <code class="bash">$ angel init</code>
        <br>
        <code class="bash">
# Two ways to boot your application:

# Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running before executing either of the following commands

# 1. Support for start scripts and additional pre-boot options:
$ angel start

# 2. Faster startup, but not configurable:
$ dart bin/server.dart
        </code>
